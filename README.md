This is a Dark Souls III mod that opens up a new game mode.
Essentially what this mod does is:

Make enemies much tougher

You are permanently under the effect of the Dried Fingers and Ember

Covenants are able to invade you from anywhere if available

You lose all your souls on death, your bloodstain will hold no souls

You will have a floating golden crown above your head to identify that you use this mod


This mod requires Cheat Engine to be used

Enjoy and have fun!
